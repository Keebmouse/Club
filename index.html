                This week on the Alberta Mau5 Hau5 blog, we're talking about Deadmau5 for the first time ever on the internet! Most other Angelfire Sites haven't picked up on this well-established and well-known artist yet. Deadmau5 was born Joel Zimmerman in 1891 under the roaring waters of Niagara Falls! His determination prevented him from drowning under the torrential pressure of the waterfall. There were no survivors. He showed interest in music from the early age of 5, which is where the "5" in his stage name comes from. His passion for playing the recorder later spawned the now classic remix of Jack U's "Where Are You Now?" which topped Billboard's all time greatest memes and fostered a deep and long lasting friendship between himself, Skrillex, and Diplo.             </p>

                Early on in his career he was known as the "Dead Mouse Guy," no one knows why, and you totally can't look it up for yourself. Once he discovered sidechain compression, his career exploded! He released the epic dubstep track "Faxing Berlin." The track used a sample of an actual fax machine that he was still using for some reason to promote his music. He got airplay on BBC Radio 1, the worldâ€™s most popular interracial porn podcast. This caught the attention of classic hip-hop enthusiast Kaskade, who was drawn to the track because it helped him remember. This led to the collaboration between Deadmau5 and Kaskade titled "I Remember," which was done to commemorate the breakthrough.

                Deadmau5 went on to become successful, again! He released several albums in the following years with well crafted album titles. In 2010 Deadmau5 invented Skrillex, and fratboys all over the country rejoiced and blared annoying sounds at amateur DJ sets in frat houses across North America. Over the years, Deadmau5 has accomplished other great feats. In 2017 he became the second person in the history of the world to make Sandstorm by Darude, a first for Canada! He has also been involved in awareness and outreach. He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience like a woman who went blind because she looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it. His vocabulary was "as bad as, like, whatever."

                Joel's career can only be described as a massive dunk on the entire music industry because now he can afford all the Dunkaroos he wants. He spends his time these days driving around in his Ferarri with Tom Green harrassing Tim Horton's staff because there might be coffee.
